## Is the constant hype immoral or simply good marketing?

Mountain biking is a sport that's known for being gear-centric. From bikes to protective gear, there are countless gadgets and accessories that are marketed towards riders. It's no surprise that the mountain bike media and industry have a vested interest in promoting these products. But, at what point does this obsession with the latest and greatest gear become excessive?

If you take a look at mountain bike media, it's easy to see that a large portion of content is focused on product reviews and gear guides. Websites like Pinkbike and Vital MTB regularly feature articles that highlight new bikes, components, and accessories. While these articles can be informative, they can also contribute to a culture of consumerism where riders feel the need to constantly upgrade their gear to keep up with the latest trends.

In an article on NSMB, writer and rider, Lacy Kemp, addresses this issue, saying, "The mountain bike industry is built on innovation, and there's nothing wrong with that. But when we focus too much on the gear and not enough on the actual riding, we risk losing sight of what this sport is all about."

Of course, having good gear is important in mountain biking. It can make the difference between a great ride and a bad one. However, it's important to recognize that gear isn't everything. As riders, we should prioritize the experience of being out on the trails and enjoying the ride, rather than constantly obsessing over the latest and greatest gear.

At the end of the day, it's up to us as riders to decide what role gear plays in our mountain biking experience. While it's important to have reliable equipment, we should remember that the sport is ultimately about having fun and exploring the great outdoors. So, the next time you're tempted to buy that shiny new bike or upgrade your suspension, take a step back and ask yourself, "Will this really improve my ride experience?" And, if the answer is no, maybe it's time to focus on something other than gear.
