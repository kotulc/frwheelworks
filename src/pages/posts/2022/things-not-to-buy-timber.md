## They call it a "Mountain Bike Bell"

And sure, it could be considered that as long as your mountain bikes are restricted to tarmac-smooth IMBA approved trails. After a few weeks of use ours self-destructed. Not once, but twice. Two different bells. Each failure occurred in not much more than a few weeks. Forget the debate of whether or not the annoying sound is worth it, this product is utter trash.

We can go on in detail about being "that guy" with the obnoxious bell, but we will save that for a different time. For now, just stop reading, step back and enjoy the silence. Have your 15 minutes back. Your welcome.
