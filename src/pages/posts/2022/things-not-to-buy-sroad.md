## A relatively inexpensive alternative to Sram and Shimano?

Nope. Not even close. If you are sick of paying top dollar for those expensive 12 speed wear items but still want something light weight we don't have any good news for you.

As far as cassettes are concerned, the mantra is cheap, light, durable - pick two. As far as SROAD cassettes are concerned you get none. Okay, maybe one. Durability-wise the 11 speed version that I still have mounted has held up... and still shifts like crap.

Did I mention I had to take a file to the 12 speed version to mount it?

### Cheap vs. Inexpensive

I had high hopes for the SROAD mountain bike cassettes, but unfortunately, they fell flat. From the poorly designed teeth and shift ramps to the shoddy manufacturing, these cassettes are simply not worth your time.

The fact is, there's a difference between cheap and inexpensive when it comes to mountain bike components. Cheap components are low-quality and poorly made, whereas inexpensive components offer great value for their price without compromising on performance or durability.

It's easy to get caught up in the allure of cheap components, especially when you're trying to save money. But the reality is that investing in quality components will ultimately save you more money in the long run, as they'll last longer and require fewer repairs and replacements.

When it comes to mountain biking, the gear and components you choose can make all the difference in your performance and enjoyment on the trails. Don't settle for cheap components that will only lead to frustration and disappointment.

Instead, do your research and invest in quality components that will enhance your riding experience and last for years to come. Trust me, your wallet and your bike will thank you.
