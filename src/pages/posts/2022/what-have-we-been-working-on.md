Over the last two seasons we have witnessed a pandemic, a global supply shock and the subsequent economic ramifications that we are still reeling from, along with various other world-changing events. Some of these events have shifted our habits, others have changed their perspectives. We haven't changed our gear-related obsessions and general bike nerdery.  
  
I have made a slight career-focused adjustment to working in a systems engineering role. Unfortunately, this means that I will necessarily be spending less time building wheels and performing wheel services. This doesn't mean that Front Range Wheel Works is closing up shop. We still have our "Internal R&D" divison, hard at work testing gear and products. Hopefully, this transition will actually lead to an even more creative and informative purpose to this site.  
  
Here is a quick taste of some of the products and DIY projects we have been testing:
