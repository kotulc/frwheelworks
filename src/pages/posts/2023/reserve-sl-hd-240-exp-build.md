After swearing off plastic hoops for what seems like the last half-decade due to a series of unfortunate events, I feel like those dark memories are sufficiently purged to allow for yet another foray into experimentation.

The latest dream build sports a Reserve 30 SL rim up front and the 30 HD variety out back. Both laced to DT's new EXP 240 hubs. Although there was some hesitation on hub choice based on circulating rumors of the revised ratchet mechanism being failure-prone, we figured why not go full send? This particular wheelset is destined for light-to-medium trail duties, most likely being swapped for something more appropriate once park and alpine season come round.

Why mix and match the SL and HD rims you might ask? Why not? When was the last time you damaged your front rim?... Well I am sure this won't end that way. The theory here is that a more radially compliant front rim should provide a better ride quality while offsetting some of the weight of the seemingly now-mandatory dual foam pool-noodle insert setup.

Once we have some more time running this setup, we will let you know if the theory holds any air.
