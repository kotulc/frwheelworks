We are a locally owned and operated wheel shop specializing in mountain bike wheels and parts. Our goal is to build and sell wheels that retain a balance of characteristics that riders care about: durability, ease of service, affordability and weight. While weight and cost are important, we select our components and build our wheels for reliability and service life first and foremost. We have spent more than enough time with un-serviceable wheels and blown hubs to understand that reliability should be paramount when building a wheel set. We build all of our wheels by hand at our headquarters in Golden Colorado; employing local wheel builders and ensuring a level of quality that factory machine built wheels can't match.

## Our services

#### Custom wheel builds

We build mountain wheels of all shapes and sizes. The wheel and build kits we list are recommendations and we are glad to accommodate any special requests in terms of components, wheel size or standard lacing patterns.

#### Wheel rebuilds

Have a set wheel that needs to be laced up to new rims? Simply mail us your hubs and we will build your new wheels around them. In addition, we offer discount rebuilds for all wheels that we sell

#### Wheel build kits

In order to provide the best possible value we stock a hand picked selection of parts from the wheel builds listed on this site. If you want to build your own wheels or have your local bike shop build you a set then our Wheel build kits offer the best value for a given build.

#### Parts and accessories

We stock parts and accessories from DT Swiss, WTB, Maxxis and Nobl; representing only the highest quality hand selected wheel components and accessories.
